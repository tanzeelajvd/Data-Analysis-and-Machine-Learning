# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains the code and documentation for performing various data analysis and machine learning tasks. Below, you will find descriptions of each task along with the corresponding algorithms used.

## Task 1: Regression Analysis with Feature Selection

In this task, we aim to perform regression analysis on a dataset consisting of at least 6-7 numerical features. The following steps are involved:

1. **Data Selection:** Find a suitable dataset for regression analysis.
2. **Multicollinearity Check:** Identify and address possible multicollinearity issues in the dataset.
3. **Feature Selection:** Apply feature selection algorithms to find the best subset of features.
4. **Model Selection:** Choose the best model based on performance and explain the rationale behind the selection.

## Task 2: Data Preprocessing for Regression Analysis

For this task, we will work with a dataset suitable for regression analysis that includes a mix of numerical, nominal, and ordinal variables. The goal is to design a machine learning pipeline that performs the following steps:

1. **Data Selection:** Find a suitable dataset for regression analysis with mixed variable types.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Scale the numerical features, encode the nominal and ordinal features, and handle missing values through imputation.

## Task 3: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

In this task, we aim to perform binary classification using logistic regression with different regularization techniques (l1 norm, l2 norm, and elastic-net). The steps involved are as follows:

1. **Data Selection:** Find a suitable dataset for binary classification.
2. **Model Training:** Apply logistic regression with different regularization techniques.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Select the best performing model based on a classification metric and provide an explanation for the choice.

## Task 4: Multi-Class Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Multinomial Regression

For this task, we will work with a dataset suitable for multi-class classification. We will compare the performance of K-nearest neighbors algorithm and multinomial regression and follow these steps:

1. **Data Selection:** Find a suitable dataset for multi-class classification.
2. **Model Training:** Apply K-nearest neighbors algorithm and multinomial regression.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Select the best performing model based on a classification metric and provide an explanation for the choice.

## Task 5: Regression with Decision Trees and Random Forests

In this task, we will perform a regression task using DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor algorithms. The steps involved are as follows:

1. **Data Selection:** Choose a suitable dataset for regression analysis.
2. **Model Training:** Apply DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor algorithms.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Select the best performing model based on the mean squared error metric and report the feature importance.

## Task 6: Logistic Regression for Classification with Scaling and Dimension Reduction

For this task, we will work with a classification dataset that includes numerical features only. The workflow involves:

1. **Data Selection:** Choose a suitable dataset for classification.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Drop categorical features and scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
3. **Dimension Reduction:** Perform dimension reduction on numerical features using PCA.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Build a LogisticRegression classifier with penalty=None and report the accuracy on unseen data.
